The difference between flex and inline-flex lies in how the container itself behaves within the layout, specifically in terms of how it is treated by its parent element. Both establish a flex container for their children, but they differ in the display behavior of the container itself:

1. flex:
Behavior: The container behaves as a block-level element, meaning it takes up the full width of its parent container by default (just like div or p elements). It also starts on a new line.

Usage: This is used when you want the flex container to behave like a block element and span the entire width of its parent container.

Example:

css
Copy code
.flex-container {
  display: flex;
}
Result: The flex container will stretch to fill the available width of its parent, and will always start on a new line.

Illustration:

Flex container takes up full width.
Block-level behavior: next element appears below.
2. inline-flex:
Behavior: The container behaves as an inline-level element, meaning it only takes up as much width as its contents need (just like span or a elements), and it can sit alongside other inline or inline-block elements on the same line.

Usage: This is useful when you want the flex container to behave like an inline element, not taking up the full width of its parent, and allowing other elements to sit next to it.

Example:

css
Copy code
.inline-flex-container {
  display: inline-flex;
}
Result: The flex container will only be as wide as its contents require and can sit on the same line as other inline elements.

Illustration:

Inline-flex container takes only necessary width.
Inline behavior: next element appears beside it.
Key Differences:
flex (block-level): The flex container behaves like a block, taking up the entire width of the parent, starting on a new line.
inline-flex (inline-level): The flex container behaves like an inline element, taking up only the necessary width and allowing other elements to sit next to it on the same line.
In summary:

Use flex when you want the container to take up the full width and behave like a block element.
Use inline-flex when you want the container to only take up the necessary width and behave like an inline element.

auto vs 100%

The difference between auto and 100% in CSS mainly relates to how width (or height) is calculated and how it adapts to the container and content. Here’s a breakdown of the two:

1. auto:
Behavior: When auto is applied to an element's width (or height), it allows the browser to calculate the size based on the content or the context (parent container or neighboring elements). This means that the element will grow or shrink to fit its content, unless restricted by other CSS rules (like max-width or padding).

Usage: Typically used when you want the element to adjust to the size of its content, taking up only as much space as needed.

Example:

css
Copy code
.box {
  width: auto;
}
Result: The element will automatically adjust its width based on its content and the available space in the parent container.

Effect: For block-level elements, auto generally makes the element as wide as the parent container, similar to 100%, but with more flexibility based on padding, margin, or other layout factors. For inline or replaced elements, the width will be as wide as the content requires.

2. 100%:
Behavior: When 100% is applied, the element's width (or height) will be exactly 100% of the parent container's width (or height). This ensures that the element will stretch to fully fill the parent, but it does not account for content size—it will always be 100% of the parent, regardless of the content inside.
Usage: Typically used when you want the element to stretch to fill the full width (or height) of its parent.
Example:
css
Copy code
.box {
  width: 100%;
}
Result: The element will take up the full width of its parent, no matter what its content size is.
Key Differences:
auto:
The width (or height) is determined by the content or available space.
More dynamic and can adapt to content size.
For block elements, behaves like 100% unless other factors (like padding, margins, or floating elements) affect it.
100%:
The element always takes up exactly 100% of the parent’s width (or height).
It doesn’t take content size into account and always stretches to match the parent.
Example Scenarios:
auto example:

css
Copy code
.auto-box {
  width: auto;
}
The box will adjust its width based on its content and any available space in the parent container.
100% example:

css
Copy code
.full-width-box {
  width: 100%;
}
The box will stretch to be exactly as wide as the parent container, regardless of its content.
Summary:
auto: The size is flexible and based on content or available space.
100%: The size is fixed to be exactly 100% of the parent container, independent of content.
